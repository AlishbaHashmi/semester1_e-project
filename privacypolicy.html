        <p>A Privacy Policy is a legal document that informs the public about the data you collect, how you collect it, and how you use it.</p>
        <p><strong>This article</strong> will cover the components of a good Privacy Policy and will help you better understand how to create one that builds trust and confidence in your customers and protects you against various liability issues. You'll also find examples of how other businesses have used Privacy Policies to comply with the law and inform customers about their privacy practices.</p>
        <p>We've also put together a <strong>Sample Privacy Policy Template</strong> that you can use to help write your own.</p>
        <br />
        <h2 id="What_Is_A_Privacy_Policy">What is a Privacy Policy?</h2>
        <p><strong><a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/privacy-policy-generator/">A Privacy Policy is a legal document</a></strong> outlining how your organization collects, uses, and discloses personal information.</p>
        <p>A properly written Privacy Policy tells customers what data you collect about them when they engage with your business (e.g., through your website) or purchase one of your products/services, and why you're collecting that information. It also lets people know how long their information will be stored, who can access these records and more.</p>

        <p>In today's business world, <strong>companies depend heavily on data and information</strong> derived from it. Indeed, information is essential for all company employees, from the top executives to the operations level.</p>
        <p>Protecting data, especially private, personal information, is crucial in a complex world where so much depends upon it. The most important step for business owners to protect their customers' data is to <strong>create a concise and transparent Privacy Policy</strong>.</p>
        <p>So, a good Privacy Policy should <strong>outline what data is being collected</strong> and explain why you're collecting it, who has access to it, and the time frame during which you plan to store it. It should also include any third parties with whom your company shares personal or private information, as well as any steps taken to ensure the security of such information.</p>
        <h2 id="A_Privacy_Policy_Is_Required_By_Law">A Privacy Policy is Required by Law</h2>
        <p><img alt="A Privacy Policy is Required by Law" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" height="200" loading="lazy" src="https://www.termsfeed.com/public/uploads/2022/07/privacy-policy-is-required-by-law.jpg" width="1000" /></p>
        <p><a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/privacy-policy-mandatory-law/">Privacy Policies are required by law</a> to be posted on your website. You may be required to include specific clauses in your Privacy Policy, depending on the applicable laws within your area or where you are conducting business.</p>
        <p>In fact, privacy laws are in place in many countries around the globe, including the following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (<a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/pipeda/">PIPEDA</a>)</li>
        <li>The California Online Privacy Protection Act (<a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/caloppa/">CalOPPA</a>)</li>
        <li>The California Consumer Privacy Act (<a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/ccpa/">CCPA</a>) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (<a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/cpra/">CPRA</a>)</li>
        <li>Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (<a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/gdpr/">GDPR</a>)</li>
        <li>Australia's <a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/australia-privacy-act-1988/">Privacy Act</a></li>
        <li>The UK's <a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/dpa-2018/">Data Protection Act</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="Third_Party_Services_Require_A_Privacy_Policy">Third Party Services Require a Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p><img alt="Third Party Services Require a Privacy Policy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" height="200" loading="lazy" src="https://www.termsfeed.com/public/uploads/2022/07/third-party-services-require-privacy-policy.jpg" width="1000" /></p>
        <p>Many third-party services that you use to improve your website's user experience, monitor analytics, or display ads <strong>require you to post a Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
        <p>You should provide clauses detailing how you use <strong>third-party services, APIs and SDKs</strong>.</p>
        <p>Just some of the most popular third-party services, which require you to post a Privacy Policy are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/privacy-policy-google-analytics/">Google Analytics</a></li>
        <li>Google AdSense</li>
        <li>Google AdWords</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/legal-policies-amazon-associates/">Amazon Associates</a></li>
        <li>ClickBank</li>
        <li>Twitter Lead Generation</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/facebook-page-privacy-policy/">Facebook Pages</a>, <a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/privacy-policy-facebook-instagram-store/">Stores</a> and <a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/privacy-policy-url-facebook-app/">Apps</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/privacy-policy-android-apps/">Google Play Store</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/ios-apps-privacy-policy/">Apple's App Store</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>A few of the reasons these third-party services require you to post a Privacy Policy and disclose your usage of their cookies and services are due to the fact that <strong>they place <a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/cookies/">cookies</a> on your visitors' computers</strong>. They also collect information about them whenever they visit your site, such as their browsing habits, the device used, and so on.</p>
        <h2 id="Always_Be_Transparent_In_Your_Privacy_Policy">Always be Transparent in Your Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p><img alt="Always be Transparent in Your Privacy Policy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" height="200" loading="lazy" src="https://www.termsfeed.com/public/uploads/2022/07/always-be-transparent-in-your-privacy-policy.jpg" width="1000" /></p>
        <p>A transparent and complete Privacy Policy agreement, which explains exactly what information a company collects and how it uses that information, inspires trust in a business.</p>
        <p>Trust is essential for companies whose business models are based on sensitive customer data. Users feel secure knowing they have control over their personal information under the terms they signed up for.</p>
        <p>Your Privacy Policy should explain to your users how your app or website handles personal data. Your users should also <strong>be aware of the reasons for collecting information</strong> and how long they will be kept on your servers.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/privacy-policy-no-personal-data-collected/">You must disclose even if you do not collect any personal information</a>. Because <strong>users expect transparency</strong>, it helps to have a Privacy Policy. Users may believe that you are collecting too much personal information and not disclosing any.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://swisscows.com/en/privacy">SwissCows search engine</a> doesn't track or store user searches. Its Privacy Policy says that it only collects the data that is necessary to provide its services and stores it in an anonymized way:</p>
        <p><img alt="Swisscows Privacy Policy: How does Swisscows protect your privacy clause" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" height="491" loading="lazy" src="https://www.termsfeed.com/public/uploads/2022/07/swisscows-privacy-policy-how-protect-your-privacy-clause.jpg" width="1000" /></p>
        <p>Conduct a privacy audit to ensure transparency and accuracy in your Privacy Policy. This will enable you to determine your business's privacy practices and what information you must disclose to your users through an appropriately transparent Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h2 id="What_Should_You_Include_In_Your_Privacy_Policy">What Should You Include in Your Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p><img alt="What Should You Include in Your Privacy Policy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" height="200" loading="lazy" src="https://www.termsfeed.com/public/uploads/2022/07/what-should-you-include-in-your-privacy-policy.jpg" width="1000" /></p>
        <p>Your Privacy Policy will contain a variety of clauses depending on your business type and applicable law. Accordingly, there are certain clauses that every website, which collects personal data from visitors, should include in their Privacy Policies.</p>
        <p>It should be structured to make it easy for the reader to understand essential information. You can achieve this by using well-structured, clearly written clauses that are clearly identified with descriptive headlines.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, let's take a look at what you should include in your Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h3 id="What_Information_Do_You_Collect">What information do you collect?</h3>
        <p>Letting your website's visitors know <strong>what information you collect</strong> is an essential part of any Privacy Policy. This clause is crucial to let your users know from the beginning if you intend to collect data that they are comfortable sharing.</p>
        <p>For instance, a website could use a registration form to collect an individual's email address, which the company then adds to its mailing list. This is very different from an app that collects all kinds of personal data, such as name, address, payment information, and location.</p>
        <p>The point here is that there is a worldwide consensus that <strong>users have the right to know</strong> exactly what kind of data you collect.</p>
        <p>Here's how <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy-row?lang=en">TikTok</a> lets users know what kinds of information it uses and collects:</p>
        <p><img alt="TikTok Privacy Policy: The types of personal data we use clause" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" height="791" loading="lazy" src="https://www.termsfeed.com/public/uploads/2022/07/tiktok-privacy-policy-types-your-personal-data-we-use-clause.jpg" width="838" /></p>
        <p>You must also keep in mind that privacy laws generally stipulate that you may only collect personal information if necessary to offer the services you provide.</p>
        <h3 id="What_Do_You_Do_With_The_Information_You_Collect">What do you do with the information you collect?</h3>
        <p>This clause informs the user about what happens to their personal data after it is collected.</p>
        <p>A website might collect information such as a user's address and name in order to ship products purchased online. This information is essential and is not collected more than necessary. This is very different from a website that collects users' names and addresses and then <strong>sells it</strong> to a third party for marketing purposes.</p>
        <p>Both websites collect the same information, but <strong>it is vital that you disclose how this information is used</strong> once it has been collected.</p>
        <p>Here's how <a href="https://www.snap.com/en-US/privacy/privacy-policy">Snap</a> discloses what it does with the information it collects:</p>
        <p><img alt="Snap Privacy Policy: How We Use Information clause excerpt" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" height="550" loading="lazy" src="https://www.termsfeed.com/public/uploads/2021/10/snap-privacy-policy-how-use-information-clause-excerpt.jpg" width="687" /></p>
        <h3 id="How_Is_Collected_Information_Kept_Safe">How is collected information kept safe?</h3>
        <p>Personal data that is collected from an individual must be kept secure and only accessible by authorized personnel. <strong>You must implement appropriate security measures</strong> if you are trusted with handling personal data about users.</p>
        <p>For example, to prevent unauthorized people from stealing or hacking your customer's credit card information, you need to secure it behind firewalls.</p>
        <p>Data breaches have been affecting millions of internet users over the last few years. Many of those affected faced severe legal and financial consequences. <strong>You are responsible</strong> to make sure that personal information is not lost or misused if you store it.</p>
        <p>Here is how <a href="https://mewe.com/privacy">MeWe</a> notifies users about how it secures the data it collects:</p>
        <p><img alt="MeWe Privacy Policy: Security: HTTPS and Encryption clause" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" height="201" loading="lazy" src="https://www.termsfeed.com/public/uploads/2021/10/mewe-privacy-policy-security-https-encryption-clause.jpg" width="607" /></p>
        <h3 id="Do_Users_Under_The_Age_Of_13_Use_Your_Website">Do users under the age of 13 use your website?</h3>
        <p>This clause is only applicable to specific websites and apps. It is regulated primarily under <a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/coppa/">COPPA</a> (the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act). COPPA imposes special requirements on apps and websites that collect data about children. It is vital to protect the privacy of all people, but <strong>it is crucial for minors</strong>.</p>
        <p>This is why there is an additional clause in the Privacy Policy for websites and apps that target children.</p>
        <p>You must comply with COPPA regulations if young people use your app or website.</p>
        <p>The kids virtual classroom website <a href="https://go.edmodo.com/privacy-policy/#Two">Edmodo</a> writes its clause on this subject like this:</p>
        <p><img alt="Edmodo Privacy Policy: How is childrens personal information treated clause" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" height="471" loading="lazy" src="https://www.termsfeed.com/public/uploads/2021/10/edmodo-privacy-policy-how-childrens-personal-information-treated-clause.jpg" width="883" /></p>
        <h3 id="Do_You_Handle_Medical_Data">Do you handle medical data?</h3>
        <p>Extra-sensitive information such as medical information is subject to additional regulation. The main law that covers additional measures for apps and websites that contain medical and health information is <a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/hipaa/">HIPAA</a> (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996).</p>
        <p>If your website or app collects health or medical information, you must comply with HIPAA regulations. Note how the health insurance company <a href="https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/privacy">Kaiser Permanente</a> provides a link to its HIPAA privacy notice within its main Privacy Statement:</p>

        <h3 id="Do_You_Handle_Financial_Or_Credit_Data">Do you handle financial or credit data?</h3>
        <p>For obvious reasons, financial information requires greater privacy protections than usual. Because financial information and credit are more sensitive than usual, several laws govern what steps must be taken by companies to protect their users from identity theft and fraud.</p>
        <p>You must comply with all laws governing financial information and credit information that you offer on your website or app. Kaiser Permanente has a simple statement on this subject.</p>

        <h3 id="Does_Your_Website_Or_App_Utilize_Third_Party_Services">Does your website or app utilize third-party services?</h3>
        <p> Privacy Policies often <strong>disclose information about third-party services</strong> used by websites. It is important to disclose information about third-party usage because the Privacy Policies of third parties may differ from yours. Users need to know who has access and what their own unique policies are, since this may affect their data.</p>
        <p>A website might use a <strong>third-party credit card processor</strong> to process transactions. Although the website does not store or handle this transaction information, users need to be able to see who has access to their credit card information and what they do with it.</p>
        <p>It can be as simple as providing the name of the third party and explaining why it is being used. The user can then read the third party's Privacy Policy to confirm their agreement with your website's policies.</p>
        <p>Here is an example from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation">Facebook's</a> Privacy Policy:</p>

        <h3 id="Additional_Clauses_In_Your_Privacy_Policy">Additional clauses in your Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>The clauses we just went over are pretty common. However, your website might require additional clauses to disclose your privacy practices and inform users about your services.</p>
        <p>Check out the Privacy Policies on your favorite websites and apps, <strong>or those of your competitors</strong>, to see what extra clauses they have, which cover the unique features and services they offer.</p>

        A Privacy Policy is a legally-required policy document between you and the users of your website/app that discloses your privacy practices and how you handle your users' personal data. A Privacy Policy will describe the types of personal data you collect, how you collect the data, how you keep it safe, what you use it for, and if you share any of that personal information with other parties.
